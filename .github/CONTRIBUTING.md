# How to Contribute

If you're unsure or afraid, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways.
The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions to our code.


## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.  

## Code Coverage

Please ensure that the coverage percentage doesn't go down with any Code changes or fixes. Tests are important even though they can be difficult to write at times.
If you do require some help with getting the tests in place please reach out.


## Pull request labels

Within our pipelines we are using [release-changelog-builder-action](https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action) to automate the creation of the change log and releases.
As part of this we will try to label all PR's with:

- feature
- fix
- test

To easily order PR's on the release notes into nice and easy sections. Where possible when committing code/rasing a pull request please try to mention what your code changes fall into.
